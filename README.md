# HopCloud - API Gateway
HopCloud is a powerful API gateway that acts as a single entry point for multiple microservices, providing unified access and advanced features for your APIs.

Features
* Request Routing: HopCloud enables you to route incoming requests to the appropriate microservice based on predefined rules and configurations.
* Load Balancing: It offers built-in load balancing capabilities, distributing traffic across multiple instances of microservices to ensure scalability and high availability.
* Authentication and Authorization: HopCloud provides authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure your APIs, including JWT token validation, API key management, and role-based access control.
* Rate Limiting: You can easily set rate limits to control the number of requests allowed per time interval, preventing abuse and ensuring fair usage.
* Logging and Monitoring: HopCloud logs request/response data and provides monitoring capabilities to track API performance, errors, and overall system health.
* Caching: It supports caching responses to improve performance and reduce backend load, caching frequently accessed data or static content.
* Transformation and Aggregation: HopCloud allows you to transform API responses and aggregate data from multiple microservices, simplifying complex API workflows.


## Prerequisites
Before getting started with HopCloud, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

* Node.js
* Docker
* Kubernetes

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the HopCloud repository:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/hopcloud.git`

2. Install dependencies:

4. Run HopCloud as a Docker container:

`docker run -p 3000:3000 hopcloud`

5. Access the HopCloud API gateway at http://localhost:8080.

## Usage
Once HopCloud is up and running, you can start utilizing its features:

* Define API routes and corresponding microservices in the config/routes.js file.
* Test the routing and load balancing functionality by sending requests to the defined routes and verifying that they are directed to the correct microservices.
* Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms by configuring the required settings in HopCloud and integrating with your authentication service.
* Set up rate limits for specific routes to prevent abuse and control access to your APIs.
* Monitor API performance and error rates using the built-in logging and monitoring capabilities.
* Leverage caching to improve response times for frequently accessed data or static content.
* Customize response transformations and data aggregation as needed.
* Refer to the HopCloud documentation for detailed information on how to use each feature and configure advanced settings.
